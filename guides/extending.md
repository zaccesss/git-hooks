# Extending

The checks in this repo are deliberately narrow: things almost anyone would want (secret
scanning, a large file guard, a force-push guard, a commit subject length limit). Anything
that reflects a personal or project-specific preference belongs in your own copy, not here.

Each hook file has a section near the bottom marked `# --- Extension point`. That is where a
new check goes.

## Adding a check

Follow the same shape every existing check uses:

```sh
# --- N. Your check name ---------------------------------------------------
your_check_hit=0

if some_condition; then
    echo "Error: describe what is wrong and why."
    your_check_hit=1
fi

if [ "$your_check_hit" -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "Fix the problem, or use '--no-verify' if this is a false positive."
    exit 1
fi
```

A few things worth keeping:

- Print a clear `Error: ...` line explaining what is wrong, not just that something failed.
- Let every check in the file run before exiting, rather than stopping at the first failure,
  so one commit attempt reports every problem at once.
- If a fix is safe to apply automatically (a pure text substitution with no ambiguity), fix it
  and re-verify the fix actually worked, following the pattern the existing trailer-stripping
  check in `commit-msg` uses, rather than only fixing it once and hoping.
- Remember to make the same change in all three platform folders (`mac/`, `linux/`,
  `windows/`) if the check does not depend on OS-specific tooling.

## Examples of what could go here

- A content-style rule (banned words or characters, a required tone).
- A required commit type prefix, for a repo following conventional commits strictly.
- A licence-header check on new source files.
- A naming convention for branches or files.
- A project-specific credential shape not already covered by the generic secret patterns in
  `pre-commit`.

## Keeping the upstream generic checks

If you want to pull in future updates to the generic checks in this repo without losing your
own additions, keep your extension in its own clearly marked block rather than interleaving it
with the existing checks. That makes a future `git pull` and re-merge far easier to reason
about.
